# SpanishDictionary

This is a simple python script to create and maintain a Spanish dictionary which I used to practice for my Spanish exams. It lets you add new entries to the dictionary, get specific translations and also run a test where the program asks you the translations for various words from the dictionary. 

The dictionary is provided as a txt file and may also be modified directly.
